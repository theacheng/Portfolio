I am absolutely in love with this app??? Like, hello, it's minimalistic??? All those fonts???? No premium and whatsoever? Yup, I'm officially in love and now I can have a diary and a story writing app in one! Thank you for this a lot! One thing I'd like to ask though. Is it possible for you to include folders (or whatever that is) in the app as well? I have a lot of things to write tbh, and I always liked organizing them by their categories so having that feature would be really nice.
