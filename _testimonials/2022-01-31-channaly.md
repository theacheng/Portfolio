Choem Thea was a great candidate. He was eager to learn and did not hesitate to ask question when he faced any challenges. He was also a great team player and a good documenter adding up to his good technical skill. Heâ€™s done a lot to improve VTENH core functionality app even though all the domain problems he was working on were quite new to him. I am sure during this internship, he has learned alot and I am really satisfied with the outcome.
