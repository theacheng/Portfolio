{% include dot.md %}
[StoryPad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tc.writestory) is a minimalist application to write stories, notes, diary, and keep your memory forever with google drive, group, and lock.

I unpublished it since I don't have time for it at this moment. It is not public in Play Store, but old users can still use it. Above UI will be the version 2.0 of StoryPad.

There is one developer & one designer and It is me :D
