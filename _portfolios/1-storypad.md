[StoryPad](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tc.writestory) is a minimalist application to write stories, notes, diary, and keep your memory forever with google drive, group, and lock. Currently has around 20k+ downloads on Play Store.

I unpublished it for now. The reason for ending the service is that I make the wrong structure of the app hard to maintain. 

Anyways, this isnâ€™t the end for StoryPad. I'm working on another project called Spooky, which has a similar concept to StoryPad with Material Design 3. I hope that the lesson that I learn from StoryPad helps us build a better app for everyone, providing the same free with no-ads experience.

Users are able to move their data from StoryPad to Spooky.
