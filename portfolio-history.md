# Pure Style version

<p class="post-meta">Aug 12, 2020 • Initialized v1</p>

This is the best website I have ever made for myself. Anyways, back then, since I have no experience in programming skills, it is very difficult for me to continue to maintain this project. This website took me around two month+ to display its complete form. It may be a bit long since I have to learn things from scratch include design & development.

# Google Sites version

<p class="post-meta">Aug 13, 2021 • Initialized v2</p>

After a year of the v1 site, I planned to build a new portfolio website to showcase the works of 2021. Google site is a good choice since it is faster to build the website. It took me around two days to design on Figma & implement it on Google Site.

# Minima + Jekyll version

<p class="post-meta">Aug 30, 2020 • Initialized v3</p>
Jekyll with minima theme is my best choice so far. It is fast & additionally, It also gives me advantages to custom my own CSS style such as timeline, button with Markdown support by default.
